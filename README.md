# php-piscine

A two week 'piscine' (swimming pool in French), or bootcamp, where the goal is to learn the basics of a language in a short period of time. This piscine was about learning the basic technologies of the web. We learned for example about web servers, databases, object-oriented programming and network & system administration. Technologies included were PHP, CSS, HTML, SQL, React and Javascript.
