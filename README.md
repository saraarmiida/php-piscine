# php-piscine

A two week 'piscine' (swimming pool in French), or bootcamp, where the goal is to learn the basics of a language in a short period of time. This piscine was about learning the basic technologies of the web. We learned for example about web servers, databases, object-oriented programming and network & system administration. Technologies included were PHP, CSS, HTML, SQL, React and Javascript.

The biggest challenge of the piscine was on the first weekend. It was to create a webshop. With a few days of learning the basics of PHP, CSS and HTML I created a working webshop with a fellow hiver. I was in charge of the frontend and he took over the backend. You can see the code for this project in the folder rush00.
